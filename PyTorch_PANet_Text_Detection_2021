Introduction
This repository contains the official implementations of PSENet, PAN, PAN++, and FAST [coming soon].

Text Detection
 PSENet (CVPR'2019)
 PAN (ICCV'2019)
 FAST (Arxiv'2021) [coming soon]
Text Spotting
 PAN++ (TPAMI'2021)
Installation
First, clone the repository locally:

git clone https://github.com/whai362/pan_pp.pytorch.git
Then, install PyTorch 1.1.0+, torchvision 0.3.0+, and other requirements:

conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install -r requirement.txt
Finally, compile codes of post-processing:

# build pse and pa algorithms
sh ./compile.sh
Dataset
Please refer to dataset/README.md for dataset preparation.

Training
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train.py ${CONFIG_FILE}
For example:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train.py config/pan/pan_r18_ic15.py
Testing
Evaluate the performance
python test.py ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE}
cd eval/
./eval_{DATASET}.sh
For example:

python test.py config/pan/pan_r18_ic15.py checkpoints/pan_r18_ic15/checkpoint.pth.tar
cd eval/
./eval_ic15.sh
Evaluate the speed
python test.py ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} --report_speed
For example:

python test.py config/pan/pan_r18_ic15.py checkpoints/pan_r18_ic15/checkpoint.pth.tar --report_speed
